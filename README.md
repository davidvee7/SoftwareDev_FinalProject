# SoftwareDev_FinalProject

Created a Grade Calculator usable by professors to assist with keeping up with students' grades and attendance.  A GUI 
lists out a student's attendance, average assignment grade, average projects grade, overall grade, email, etc.  The application
uses an excel spreadsheet for its database.
